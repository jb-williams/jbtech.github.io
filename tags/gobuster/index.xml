      <description>SimpleCTF TryHackMe performed by: jb-williams Simple CTF Deploy the machine and attempt the questions! Initial Scan First we run nmap on the target IP. The first scan didn&amp;rsquo;t give me any info and even suggested adding -Pn to the command: nmap -v -T4 -sV -sC -Pn -oA nmap/initial 10.10.237.242 This output will provide the answers for the first two questions. In the nmap output I noticed that the ftp service on port 21 allowed anonymous login.</description>
