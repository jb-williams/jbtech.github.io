      <description>Pickle Rick TryHackMe performed by: jb-williams Pickle Rick To access the box add the machines IP to this https://&amp;lt;IP&amp;gt;.p.thmlabs.com
Traveling to the sight we can start gathering information First it is always good to View Page Source to see if there are any information disclosers accidently left in the html source code. Doing so, you can see that a comment left in the source code is reminding Rick that the user name for their account is R1ckRul3s Now we scan the box with nmap to see what info we can gather.</description>

      <description>Kenobi THM performed by: jb-willams Deploy the vulnerable machine Scan the machine with nmap, how many ports are open? Deploy the Machine and scan it with nmap nmap -v -p- -sV -sC -T4 -oA nmap/initial 10.10.223.56 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; grep -i &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; nmap/initial.nmap | cut -d&amp;#39; &amp;#39; -f 1 | cut -d&amp;#39;/&amp;#39; -f1 | tee nmap/ports.txt | wc -l notice, you may get some false positives that will have unknown service, ignore them</description>

      <description>Vulnversity Walkthrough TryHackMe performed by: jb-williams Reconnaisance They first ask for you to search for any nmap resourses(cheatsheets) online, I came across this one that seemed really useful: https://www.stationx.net/nmap-cheat-sheet/
The First Real Question
Scan the box, how many ports are open? I like to build up a chain of commands for most boxes.
While doing my scans I like to create a file that contains just the numerical port values to have.</description>

      <description>GPG performed by: jb-williams GPG(GnuPrivacyGuard) is an Open Source implementation of PGP(PrettyGoodPrivacy). It allows you to encrypt/decrypt and sign data communications.
A quick walkthrough of GPG.
Works on most all OS&amp;rsquo;s, this will be a Linux, and quick Windows walkthrough.
Public/Private Keys:
You make a Public Key and a Private Key(always keep Private Key safe and do not share with anyone). You give you Public Key out to anyone. They use your Public Key to encrypt the message they want to send to you and you decrypt it with your Private Key.</description>

      <description>LUKS USB Encryption for Linux performed by: jb-williams This is the process I use to partition and encrypt usb drives.
I have not tested tested it on anything other than usb&amp;rsquo;s, though a similar process would potentially work. !! Notice !! Running these commands on the wrong drive could Erase All Data on that Drive!!
Only Recoverable if You Had a Backup Make sure you know: Device Name(ie: /dev/sdb) Device Size(ie: 15GiB) REQS:</description>

      <description>Brightxf performed by: jb-williams !! Run at Own Risk !!
No issues have come from my use of these but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean there won&amp;rsquo;t be I enjoy making/finding the most minimal gui and still be functional as a daily-driver(functional specifically to my needs). I tend to prefer cwm, a simple window manager, and sxhkd, used as a hot-key daemon, and I test my setup on several different laptops of different specs.</description>
