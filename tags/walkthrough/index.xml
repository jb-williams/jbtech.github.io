      <description>SimpleCTF TryHackMe performed by: jb-williams Simple CTF Deploy the machine and attempt the questions! Initial Scan First we run nmap on the target IP. The first scan didn&amp;rsquo;t give me any info and even suggested adding -Pn to the command: nmap -v -T4 -sV -sC -Pn -oA nmap/initial 10.10.237.242 This output will provide the answers for the first two questions. In the nmap output I noticed that the ftp service on port 21 allowed anonymous login.</description>

      <description>Pickle Rick TryHackMe performed by: jb-williams Pickle Rick To access the box add the machines IP to this https://&amp;lt;IP&amp;gt;.p.thmlabs.com&#xA;Traveling to the sight we can start gathering information First it is always good to View Page Source to see if there are any information disclosers accidently left in the html source code. Doing so, you can see that a comment left in the source code is reminding Rick that the user name for their account is R1ckRul3s Now we scan the box with nmap to see what info we can gather.</description>

      <description>Vulnversity Walkthrough TryHackMe performed by: jb-williams Reconnaisance They first ask for you to search for any nmap resourses(cheatsheets) online, I came across this one that seemed really useful: https://www.stationx.net/nmap-cheat-sheet/&#xA;The First Real Question&#xA;Scan the box, how many ports are open? I like to build up a chain of commands for most boxes.&#xA;While doing my scans I like to create a file that contains just the numerical port values to have.</description>

Came back with these results and noticed ports 138 and 445, which are usually SMB so I ran nmap with specific SMB scripts: the first one could work but I don&amp;rsquo;t think my VM could handle it so I did a little research and ran the second cmd</description>
